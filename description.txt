Rena's Extra Blocks & Extended Logic: adds a bunch of nifty new blocks which desperately need better graphics.

Physics Blocks
- Bounce Blocks: Repels things away on touch.
- Boost Blocks: Accelerates things in a specific direction on touch.
    - Right-click to change direction.
- Gravity Blocks (NOT WORKING): Flips gravity, much like the potions. Pressing Up will reset it, but doesn't let you flip it again.
    - These "work" but the effect is incomplete.

Sensors (use with wires)
- Time Sensor: Emits a signal every in-game hour.
- Random Sensor: Emits a signal at random.
- Rapid Timer: Emits a signal every two frames.
    - Not everything plays nicely with this. For example, torches' states won't change. Especially if the game lags, signals can be dropped.
    - The activation state saves between sessions, unlike vanilla timers.

Wire Helper Blocks
- Isolator: Passes signals across short gaps.
    - Has three modes, selected by right-click: Bidirectional, transmit only, receive only.
    - When a signal arrives at a transmitter, it's broadcast to all receivers within a 5x5 square centred on the input.
    - This allows signals to cross small gaps, jump from one wire color to another, and pass in only one direction (a diode).
    - Each lights up when sending/receiving a signal.
- Delay Timer: Receives a signal from an Isolator and sends it along a wire some number of frames later.
    - Right-click to change delay, in frames: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, random.
    - Lights up when transmitting.

Cheaty/Fun Blocks
- Heal/Hurt Blocks: Heals or hurts anyone who touches them.
    - Hammer to change their mode; alternates between hurt, heal, hurt lots, heal lots.

Decorative Blocks
- Letter Blocks: Single-tile non-solid blocks for every ASCII character so you can make big signs.
    - Right-click works like the Shift key, to change case/punctuation.

Numeric Display
- Four blocks that work together to create a digital display that can be increased, decreased, or cleared by activating them (using wire or right-click).
- Numeric Display Digit: When placed, displays a 0. When activated, increases the digit by 1.
- Numeric Increment Block: When activated, looks for a nearby Numeric Display Digit and increases it by 1.
- Numeric Decrement Block: When activated, looks for a nearby Numeric Display Digit and decreases it by 1.
- Numeric Clear Block: When activated, looks for Numeric Display Digits to its left and resets them to 0.

Numeric Display Digits can be chained. When a Digit is increased past 9, it resets to 0; if the block to its left is another Digit, that block is increased too. Similarly, when decreased past 0, it resets to 9 and decreases the block to its left.

If the block to the left is not a Digit, it will check to the left of that block; if that also isn't a Digit, the process stops. This means you can place single blocks (of any kind, including empty space) between the digits to separate them.

Additionally, when a Digit wraps from 9 to 0, it sends a signal over any wire immediately above it. When it wraps from 0 to 9, it sends a signal over any wire immediately below it. Note that whatever is on the other end of that wire must not be touching the Digit block to be activated.

The Increment and Decrement blocks will search for a Digit block to their left, to their right, above them, and below them (in that order); if one is found within 16 blocks, they'll operate on it.

The Clear block only clears digits to its immediate left, ignoring any Increment/Decrement blocks. The same one-block gap rule applies.

The values of Digit blocks save between sessions.
