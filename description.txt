Rena's Extra Blocks & Extended Logic: adds a bunch of nifty new blocks which desperately need better graphics.

Physics Blocks
- Bounce Blocks: Repels things away on touch.
- Boost Blocks: Accelerates things in a specific direction on touch.
    - Right-click to change direction.
- Gravity Blocks (NOT WORKING): Flips gravity, much like the potions. Pressing Up will reset it, but doesn't let you flip it again.
    - These "work" but the effect is incomplete.

Sensors (use with wires)
- Time Sensor: Emits a signal every in-game hour.
- Random Sensor: Emits a signal at random.
- Rapid Timer: Emits a signal every two frames.
    - Not everything plays nicely with this. For example, torches' states won't change.

Cheaty/Fun Blocks
- Heal/Hurt Blocks: Heals or hurts anyone who touches them.
    - Hammer to change their mode; alternates between hurt, heal, hurt lots, heal lots.

Decorative Blocks
- Letter Blocks: Single-tile non-solid blocks for every ASCII character so you can make big signs.
    - Right-click works like the Shift key, to change case/punctuation.

Numeric Display
Four blocks that work together to create a digital display that can be increased, decreased, or cleared by activating them (using wire or right-click).
- Numeric Display Block: When placed, displays a 0. When activated, increases the digit by 1.
- Numeric Increment Block: When activated, looks for a nearby Numeric Display Block and increases it by 1.
- Numeric Decrement Block: When activated, looks for a nearby Numeric Display Block and decreases it by 1.
- Numeric Clear Block: When activated, looks for Numeric Display Blocks to its left and resets them to 0.

Numeric Display Blocks can be chained. When a block is increased past 9, it resets to 0; if the block to its left is another Numeric Display Block, that block is increased too. Similarly, when decreased past 0, it resets to 9 and decreases the block to its left.

If the block to the left is not a Numeric Display Block, it will check to the left of that block; if that also isn't a Numeric Display Block, the process stops. This means you can place single blocks (of any kind, including empty space) between the digits to separate them.

Additionally, when a Numeric Display Block wraps from 9 to 0, it sends a signal over any wire immediately above it. When it wraps from 0 to 9, it sends a signal over any wire immediately below it.

The Increment and Decrement blocks will search for a Numeric block to their left, to their right, above them, and below them (in that order); if one is found within 16 blocks, they'll operate on it.

The Clear block only clears digits to its immediate left, ignoring any Increment/Decrement blocks. The same one-block gap rule applies.

The values of Numeric blocks save between sessions.
