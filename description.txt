Rena's Extra Blocks & Extended Logic: adds a bunch of nifty new blocks which desperately need better graphics.

Physics Blocks
- Bounce Blocks: repels things away on touch.
- Boost Blocks: accelerates things in a specific direction on touch.
    - Right-click to change direction.
- Gravity Blocks (NOT WORKING): flips gravity, much like the potions. Pressing Up will reset it, but doesn't let you flip it again.
    - These "work" but the effect is incomplete.

Cheaty/Fun Blocks
- Heal/Hurt Blocks: Heals or hurts anyone who touches them.
    - Hammer to change their mode; alternates between hurt, heal, hurt lots, heal lots.

Decorative Blocks
- Single-tile non-solid blocks for every ASCII character so you can make big signs.
