Rena's Extra Blocks & Extended Logic: adds a bunch of nifty new blocks which desperately need better graphics. How you use them is up to you!

[c/CC88CC:Physics Blocks]
- [c/88CCCC:Boost Blocks]: Accelerates things in a specific direction on touch.
- [c/88CCCC:Bounce Blocks]: Repels things away on touch.
- [c/88CCCC:Gravity Blocks]: Flips gravity when touched, much like the potions.
- [c/88CCCC:One-Way Blocks]: Can only be passed through from one direction.

[c/CC88CC:Sensors] (use with wires)
- [c/88CCCC:Time Sensor]: Emits a signal every N in-game minutes. Right-click to adjust.
- [c/88CCCC:Random Sensor]: Emits a signal at random.
- [c/88CCCC:Rapid Timer]: Emits a signal every two frames (1/30 second).
- [c/88CCCC:Blood Moon Sensor]: Emits a signal when the Blood Moon rises and/or falls.
- [c/88CCCC:Rain Sensor]: Emits a signal when rain starts and/or stops.

[c/CC88CC:Wire Helper Blocks]
- [c/88CCCC:Isolator]: Passes signals across short gaps and to other Wire Helper Blocks. Can be used as a diode.
- [c/88CCCC:Delay Timer]: Receives a signal from an Isolator and sends it along a wire some number of frames later.
- [c/88CCCC:Signal Counter]: Receives signals from Isolators; emits a signal along a wire for every N singals received.

[c/CC88CC:Numeric Display]
- Four blocks that work together to create a digital display that can be increased, decreased, or cleared by activating them (using wire or right-click). See below for details.
- [c/88CCCC:Numeric Display Digit]: When placed, displays a 0. When activated, increases the digit by 1.
- [c/88CCCC:Numeric Increment Block]: When activated, looks for a nearby Numeric Display Digit and increases it by 1.
- [c/88CCCC:Numeric Decrement Block]: When activated, looks for a nearby Numeric Display Digit and decreases it by 1.
- [c/88CCCC:Numeric Clear Block]: When activated, looks for Numeric Display Digits to its left and resets them to 0.

[c/CC88CC:Decorative Blocks]
- [c/88CCCC:Letter Blocks]: Single-tile non-solid blocks for every ASCII character so you can make big signs.
- [c/88CCCC:Rainbow Lamp]: A light that slowly cycles through the colors of the rainbow. (Colors may not be visible depending which lighting mode you've set in the game's video settings.)

[c/CC88CC:Consumable Blocks]
- [c/88CCCC:Coin], [c/88CCCC:Heart], [c/88CCCC:Star]: Work the same as the drop versions, but are a floating block. Use them to make platforming challenges!

[c/CC88CC:Misc Fun/Cheaty Blocks]
- [c/88CCCC:Heal Blocks]: Heals anyone who touches them. Hammer to switch intensity.
- [c/88CCCC:Hurt Blocks]: Hurts anyone who touches them. Hammer to switch intensity.
- [c/88CCCC:Purity Shield]: Prevents anything in its radius from being converted to Corruption, Crimson, or Hallow.
- [c/88CCCC:Portable Sun]: Lights up EVERTHING. Or at least, a very large area.

[c/CC88CC:How to Use]

Most of the blocks can just be placed anywhere, even in midair. Solid ones can be changed to different variations by hammering them; non-solid ones by right-clicking. (This is because hammering non-solid blocks doesn't work right now; it will be changed eventually.)

[c/88CCCC:Letter Block]: These don't do anything. Use them to make big signs and stuff. Right-click to change between upper/lowercase or punctuation (works like the Shift key). Can be painted using deep paints.

[c/88CCCC:Boost Block]: When a player or NPC touches them, they're accelerated in the direction the block indicates. These are non-solid, so they can be used to simulate currents. Right-click to change the direction. Be careful not to get stuck between opposing blocks!

[c/88CCCC:Bounce Block]: When a player or NPC touches them, they get bounced away.

[c/88CCCC:One-Way Block]: Non-solid, unless you approach them from the indicated direction. (Causes some visual jitter; should be fixed in the future.)

[c/88CCCC:Gravity Block]: When a player (unfortunately, not an NPC) touches it, gravity reverses for them, just like a Gravitation Potion. Pressing Up will reset it back to normal (and won't let you keep controlling it afterward) just in case you fall into space. These won't activate if you already have a Gravitation Potion active, but using one while under the block's effect will only waste it.

[c/88CCCC:Heal/Hurt Blocks]: When a player or NPC (including monsters!) touches it, they'll be healed or hurt, depending on the block. How much depends on the mode, which is set by hammering.

[c/88CCCC:Purity Shield]: When placed, and whenever someone is nearby, converts all nearby Corrupt/Crimson/Hallowed blocks/NPCs into their pure versions. (Nearby means within a 9x9 square centred on the Shield.) Non-corrupt monsters such as Zombies won't be affected (and corrupt ones will still be monsters after purification), so this isn't a complete safety field.

[c/88CCCC:Coin] and other consumables: When touched, they drop an item and disappear.

If an actuator is placed on these, they become reusable. Collecting them turns them into an outline; actuating them turns them back into collectible blocks. You can use this to reset your platforming stage without worrying about ones that weren't collected.

If no actuator is placed, they simply disappear forever when collected.

[c/88CCCC:Sensors]: Like the vanilla sensors, attach a wire to them and they'll send a signal on it.

Note, some things don't handle the Rapid Timer nicely; for example, torches' states might not update. This is especially noticeable if the game is lagging.

The Blood Moon and Rain sensors have three modes: On Begin/End, On Begin Only, On End Only. They do not need to be directly exposed to rain/moonlight; they'll work even underground.

[c/88CCCC:Isolator]: These work as short-range wireless transmitters. They have three modes: Bidirectional, Transmit Only, Receive Only. Each should be connected to a wire.

When a signal enters a transmitter, it's relayed to any receivers within a 5x5 square centred on the transmitter. Anything else is skipped over. This means they can send the signal across a short gap without interfering with any wiring in the gap.

The receiver will send along all wires connected to it, regardless of the color that activated the transmitter. There can be multiple receivers in range.
A transmitter and receiver used together form a simple diode (signals pass through in one direction only).

Due to limitations of the wiring engine, you may need at least one empty space between a receiver and the thing on the other end of its wire.

[c/88CCCC:Delay Timer]: Acts as a receiver for an Isolator. Waits N frames before relaying the signal along its wire. N can be changed by right-clicking.

[c/88CCCC:Signal Counter]: Acts as a receiver for an Isolator. For every N signals received from the transmitter, it emits one signal along its wire.

[c/88CCCC:Numeric Display]: Makes a simple counter that can be controlled by wires or right-click.
Right-clicking a digit or sending a signal to it will increase it by 1. When it reaches 10, it resets to 0 and increases the digit to its left.
The search for another digit checks one, then two blocks to the left, so there can be gaps (any non-digit block, air, etc) for separators.

The Increment and Decrement Blocks let you control nearby digits (by right-click or wire). They look for a Digit to their left, right, above, and below (in that order). If one is found within 16 blocks, it will be increased/decreased. Only one Digit will be affected, even if there are others nearby. (These do not look in a square area, only four straight lines.)

The Clear Block looks for digits to its left, and resets them to zero. It will skip over single empty spaces (same as the digits themselves) and Increment/Decrement/Clear blocks.

When a Digit Block reaches 10, it resets to 0, increases the block to its left, and sends a signal along a wire immediately above it. When it reaches -1, it resets to 9, decreases the block to its left, and sends a signal along a wire immediately below it.

The values of digits are saved between sessions.
