# Functional bugs
- one-way gates might not work when you're going super fast
- some things can be changed by hammering, others by right-click
    - this is a tModLoader limitation since hammering non-solid tiles doesn't work
- Configurator isn't currently used.
    - ideally, use it instead of right-click so that you can control who's able to configure things.
        - make it a config option whether right-click works or not.
    - I think it also doesn't have a recipe. (or only the dumb default one)

# Visual bugs
- one-way gates cause jitter
    - actually acceptable for horizontal because it's like they're pushing you back (well, they are) but would be better if they worked like walls
    - for vertical it's awful
- the graphics are bad, someone please make better ones
    - especially some things are missing slope graphics and the UI is ugly
- the letter tiles and Numeric Display Digit all appear as a blank brick while being placed, but show up correctly once placed.
    - I'm sure this is trivial to fix but nobody can tell me how
