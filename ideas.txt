- an item you use to configure some of these
    - use it, click a block, and it pops up some UI
- an item that prompts for text and plops letter blocks
- an item that pops up an instruction manual for all this shit
- better mine cart stuff
    - brakes (slows you if above a certain speed)
    - boosters that work in whichever direction you're facing
        - can be turned off with wires
    - junctions that can be switched by wires
- black hole block, draws you toward it
    - magnet block, draws metal toward it
- brick that shatters when hit from below
- block that explodes on touch
- donut block
    - block that shatters when stood on for a while
- block that "moves" by swapping itself with an adjacent tile
    - dunno how that would work with tiles that are > 1x1
- functioning clock (check game time in animation routines)
    - would need some custom draw method to draw hands/digits
    - large version using 4 number tiles
- more sensors; signal/change solidity when...
    - touched by NPCs
        - detect only friend/foe
    - on player join/leave server
    - weather
    - you catch a fish
    - you touch/near/right-click them with a certain item/# of coins in your inventory
        - optionally, remove the item and/or block
    - hit by explosion/bullet/minion/pet/...
    - you have a certain minion/pet with you
    - touched by player/NPC of certain gender
    - player spawns/world is loaded
    - certain amount of light hits it? (ModifyLight?)
        - sounds like that method is just used to determine what light color a lighted tile emits, so wouldn't be useful.
    - touched for a certain amount of time/a certain number of times
    - you press various keys
    - player has some buff/debuff, like Stinky
    - player nearby gets healed/hurt/has low HP/mana/dies/is a ghost
    - player is in water/upside down/touching ground/in a minecart/on a mount
    - player has been nearby for a while
    - an invasion/party is happening
    - touched by something with certain velocity
    - the game is lagging/FPS is below X
    - pass signals to an adjacent block when...
        - certain time of day/IRL wall time
        - certain NPC nearby/is in town
        - certain number of signals received
        - certain pattern of signals received (time-based or wire order)
            - eg if received signals on red, then green, then blue
        - signal received X frames ago (delay)
- other consumable blocks like the coin - health/mana refills, item pickups...
    - ones that don't disappear but just become inactive for a while
- fire
    - every frame, random chance to spread to adjacent blocks of certain types
        - damage them like pickaxe would; if destroyed, replace with fire
    - when hit by water, turn back into what used to be there/dirt/air/ash block
- heal/hurt blocks but non-solid (gas blocks)
- turret; fires projectiles at nearby enemies
- speed limit block (slows you down like honey but less so)
    - or subtracts coins if you move too fast :V
- when touched, prompt for a password (use the sign text entry?)
    - if correct, vanish/teleport player past/emit signal
- blocks that control the keyboard RGB stuff
- letter blocks that can be actuated, turning them invisible, allowing for animated text reveals
- cheat stuff
    - just drop a specific item every time it's activated
    - biome override - while you're near it you're in X biome no matter what
        - especially fun if actuated...
    - time/weather override
    - heal/nuke any NPC that gets near (Heal/Hurt Block but with large radius)
    - while player is near, all enemies take damage

- show message in chat suggesting you take a break every hour
- remove the screen-flip effect from gravity potions
- apply trippy visuals like motion blur and color cycling to everything
