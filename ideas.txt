    - letter blocks that can be actuated, turning them invisible, allowing for animated text reveals
    - curtains that open/close when clicked

- weird stuff
    - block that "moves" by swapping itself with an adjacent tile
        - dunno how that would work with tiles that are > 1x1
    - fire
        - every frame, random chance to spread to adjacent blocks of certain types
            - damage them like pickaxe would; if destroyed, replace with fire

    - you have a certain minion/pet with you
    - touched by player/NPC of certain gender
    - player spawns/world is loaded
    - certain amount of light hits it? (ModifyLight?)
        - sounds like that method is just used to determine what light color a lighted tile emits, so wouldn't be useful.
    - touched for a certain amount of time/a certain number of times
    - you press various keys
    - player has some buff/debuff, like Stinky

        - certain NPC nearby/is in town
        - certain number of signals received
        - certain pattern of signals received (time-based or wire order)
            - eg if received signals on red, then green, then blue
        - signal received X frames ago (delay)

- turret; fires projectiles at nearby enemies
- when touched, prompt for a password (use the sign text entry?)
    - if correct, vanish/teleport player past/emit signal
- blocks that control the keyboard RGB stuff


- cheat stuff
    - heal/hurt blocks but non-solid (gas blocks)
    - just drop a specific item every time it's activated
    - biome override - while you're near it you're in X biome no matter what
        - especially fun if actuated...
    - anti-corruption blocks - whenever you're near/on the "random update" tick, they cleanse any corrupted blocks within some radius
        - can they spread, themselves? or wouldn't that require placing more of themselves, instead of just converting blocks?
    - time/weather override
    - heal/nuke any NPC that gets near (Heal/Hurt Block but with large radius)
    - while player is near, all enemies take damage


Unrelated mod ideas:
- show message in chat suggesting you take a break every hour
- remove the screen-flip effect from gravity potions
- apply trippy visuals like motion blur and color cycling to everything
- count how many in-game days have passed in the world
- an item/equip that highlights corrupted/crimson/hallowed blocks (like miner's glowstick but for these instead)
