- coin block
    - touch it, it vanishes and you gain one coin
- better mine cart stuff
    - brakes (slows you if above a certain speed)
    - boosters that work in whichever direction you're facing
        - can be turned off with wires
    - junctions that can be switched by wires
- block that toggles the gravity flip effect on touch or on right click
    - implemented but kinda useless because that effect doesn't let you jump
- black hole block, draws you toward it
    - magnet block, draws metal toward it
