    - brick that shatters when hit from below
    - donut block

- decorative stuff
    - functioning clock (check game time in animation routines)
        - would need some custom draw method to draw hands/digits
        - large version using 4 number tiles
    - letter blocks that can be actuated, turning them invisible, allowing for animated text reveals
    - curtains that open/close when clicked

- weird stuff
    - block that "moves" by swapping itself with an adjacent tile
        - dunno how that would work with tiles that are > 1x1
    - fire
        - every frame, random chance to spread to adjacent blocks of certain types
            - damage them like pickaxe would; if destroyed, replace with fire
        - when hit by water, turn back into what used to be there/dirt/air/ash block
    - when touched, prompt for a password (use the sign text entry?)
        - if correct, vanish/teleport player past/emit signal
    - blocks that control the keyboard RGB stuff

- more sensors; signal/change solidity/pass signals when...
    - touched by NPCs
        - detect only friend/foe
    - on player join/leave server
    - weather
    - you catch a fish
    - you touch/near/right-click them with a certain item/# of coins in your inventory
        - optionally, remove the item and/or block
    - hit by explosion/bullet/minion/pet/...
    - you have a certain minion/pet with you
    - touched by player/NPC of certain gender
    - player spawns/world is loaded
    - certain amount of light hits it? (ModifyLight?)
        - sounds like that method is just used to determine what light color a lighted tile emits, so wouldn't be useful.
            - it's called with ref r,g,b but they're 0 by default.

        - certain time of day/IRL wall time
        - certain NPC nearby/is in town
        - certain pattern of signals received (time-based or wire order)
            - eg if received signals on red, then green, then blue
- can we control whether signals flow by just changing whether our tile has a wire?

- turret; fires projectiles at nearby enemies
- play sound effect on signal (but how to choose which?)

- cheat stuff
    - heal/hurt blocks but non-solid (gas blocks)
    - just drop a specific item every time it's activated

        - especially fun if actuated...
    - time/weather override
    - heal/nuke any NPC that gets near (Heal/Hurt Block but with large radius)
    - while player is near, all enemies take damage


Unrelated mod ideas:
- show message in chat suggesting you take a break every hour
- apply trippy visuals like motion blur and color cycling to everything
- count how many in-game days have passed in the world
- an item/equip that highlights corrupted/crimson/hallowed blocks (like miner's glowstick but for these instead)
- hook into the keyboard RGB stuff and make it do something else, like control some custom hardware or just change lighting in-game
- accessibility stuff
    - hook into sound effect playing and display icons indicating the type of sound and its direction/location
        - https://github.com/direwolf420/TerrariaSoundSuite does this
    - remove the screen-flip effect from gravity potions
    - allow binding more things to mouse buttons to make it somewhat playable one-handed
    - color filters for mod graphic designers to test colorblindness
